# DEngine

Game engine project by Didgy (Nils Petter Sk√•lerud)

How to build:

Windows:
The project can be built as-is on MSVC. 
For building on MinGW, you will need the LunarG Vulkan SDK installed.

Linux:
Currently not supported. Will support if I find an elegant solution for GLFW, or whenever I go back to SDL2 for windowing.

NOTE! 32-bit is not supported.


The engine uses the following libraries:
* GLEW
* SDL2
* OpenGL
* Vulkan / LunarG
* nlohmann
* fx-gltf
* stb_image
