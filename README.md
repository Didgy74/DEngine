# DEngine

Game engine project by Didgy (Nils Petter Sk√•lerud)

How to build:

Windows:
The project can be built as-is on MSVC and MinGW

Linux:
Currently not supported. Will support if I find an elegant solution for GLFW, or whenever I go back to SDL2 for windowing.

Ubuntu packages required to build:
libglew-dev
libglfw3-dev

NOTE! 32-bit is not supported.


The engine uses the following libraries:
* GLEW
* GLFW
* OpenGL
* nlohmann
* fx-gltf
* stb_image
